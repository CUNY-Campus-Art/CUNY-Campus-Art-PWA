# CUNY-Campus-Art-PWA

You can test our PWA by visting the following link:<a href="https://cuny-gallery.web.app/"> https://cuny-gallery.web.app/ </a>

Our CUNY Campus Art PWA aims to promote art on CUNY campuses. We chose to make it a PWA so that a student would not need to download any app and can use the site directly.
- It allows the student to scan a QR code associated with an artwork to retrieve more information about it.
  - The app has a built in personalized QR scanner that student can use to scan.
  - The student also has the option of uploading a picture that has the QR code.
- Student can create an account, login, and a history of scanned artworks can be saved as well as removed.
- We are in the process of gamifying this app, by creating a Scavenger Hunt in which students can solve clues

Update: 10/12/20 - The information tab and gallery tab now holds dynamic data that is pulled from the database.
